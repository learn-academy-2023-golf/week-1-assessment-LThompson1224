### 📝 Feedback

If you would like specific feedback please leave details here: hey , i was completely confused on the correct way to do the coding challenges simply because i wanted to be honest and do them on my own with no help . i just didnt know how to starv or finish the challenge nor explain what i was doing . outside of that i think i did ok on my first assessment!
