// ASSESSMENT 1: Coding Conceptual Questions

// Examine the following examples.

// First, predict the outcome based on your understanding of the code.
// Then, uncomment the console.log() and verify the output. Briefly explain why your initial answer was correct or incorrect.
// There is no need to change any of the code.

// --------------------INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What will this log?
//const colors = ["tangerine", "magenta", "lilac", "daffodil"]
// console.log(colors.push("indigo"))

// a) Your answer:
// b) Verify and explain:

// 11-------------------1) What will this log?

//const cohort = "LEARN 2023"
 //console.log(cohort.length)

// a) Your answer: 11
// b) Verify and explain: // i thought the answer would be 11 but i think i counted wrong because when i ran it in my terminal it gave me 10 but my concept was correct so i feel ggod about that. the correct answer is 10

// -------------------2) What will this log?

//const greeting = "Hello World!"
 //console.log(greeting[4])

// a) Your answer:l
// b) Verify and explain: The answer was 0 . i thought that it would identify the letter but it didnt .

// --------------------3) What will this log?
//const languages = ["JavaScript", "Ruby", "Python", "C++"]
//const index = 1
// console.log(languages[index])

// a) Your answer: Ruby 
// b) Verify and explain: the answer was ruby and if my thinking was correct . it was ruby because the index would start at 0 and count forward which would instead of giving you the amount in numbers i beleive the command index gives you the string that is in that spot.

// --------------------4) What will this log?

//const weekendDays = ["saturday", "sunday"]
 //console.log(weekendDays.toUpperCase())

// a) Your answer: "SATURDAY", "SUNDAY"
// b) Verify and explain: from my understanding in class if the code is typed correctly this should be the outcome . but when i input this outcome into the terminal it says that its not a function, however i may be doing something wrong and im not sure.

// --------------------5) What will this log?

//const dataTypes = ["number", "string", "Boolean", "undefined"]
 //console.log(typeof dataTypes.length)

// a) Your answer: it should be the amount of characters in the code 
// b) Verify and explain: the answer when i input the code into the terminal says number and i dont quite understand why.
